# capaPlan
ultimate capacity planning tool<br />
Here is the what we want to achieve<br />

The essence is to move from doing the stuff to doing the stuff that do the stuff.<br />

Understand that our job is full of (resentful) repetitions (cycles of studies of all kinds and names, are they NOT the same stuff?).<br />
I want to eliminate repetition and make our jobs more meaningful.<br />
because of repetition (and inefficiency of shared files, humongous excel files, antique company software), <br />
we begin to question our value (why am i doing this #$%^?), <br />
we begin to feel frustration (mouse flied over), <br />
we begin to regret (why am i here?????)<br />

hope you can join me to make this happen.<br />

hopefully, with this we are able to cater for all kinds of requests in a more pleasant way, and the same job will not require more effort than a few lines of code.<br />
the rest of time, we could dedicate to make this system more and more robust and up to the morning day requirement and latest patches of python package.<br />

here is why python is chosen:<br />

it is an robust and up-to-date language<br />
code somehow follows english grammar<br />
it is an OOP language<br />
fast to learn<br />

why company software + excel is abandoned:<br />

company software is developed in the 1999, function is rigid, thus we invented ADDER to make it flexible<br />
ADDER in excel made thins better, also made things worse (chaotic version control, un-savable shared files, unreadable excel super long formulas, super inefficient VBA codes)<br />

now here is the pitch and some question to answer <br />
    - what is the current issues <br />
        the number of scenario are increasing, so is the complexity <br />
        the number of people are reducing <br />
        the jobs people do contain a big portion of repetition <br />
        efforts are not spent in a more value adding way <br />
        we also need a 1 stop sauce file as the base number we used in capacity planning, not that people no need to ask around <br />
        or check the some official file which is outdated, or not practical <br />
    - why current issues are not solved despite the efforts <br />
        we tried to make 'MACROs' and other stuff to make our lives easier <br />
        they are not working as we are facing 2 facts.  <br />
        one is the our planning program is too rigid, there is no way to either abandon or change it <br />
        the other one is excel is too free for all, thus all the effort spent to standardize almost failed <br />
    - why python is able to help <br />
        it is not rigid and it required standardization to work <br />
        however, lots of training is required and people are busy <br />
    - what will it look like? <br />
        still do the same thing, now instead of doing that, we use python to properly re-animate the things we do <br />
        
        
    

thus we need to: <br />
    1. Create a capacity simulation tool that is suitable for most of the manufacturing environments.<br />
    2. Create a scenario study pack to analyse what if conditions, and give summaries<br />
    3. move on to the capex changes<br />
